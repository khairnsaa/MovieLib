                    A criminal mastermind who goes by The Professor has a plan to pull off the biggest heist
                    in recorded history -- to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To help him carry out
                    the
                    ambitious plan, he recruits eight people with certain abilities and who have nothing to lose. The
                    group
                    of thieves take hostages to aid in their negotiations with the authorities, who strategize to come
                    up
                    with a way to capture The Professor. As more time elapses, the robbers prepare for a showdown with
                    the
                    police.
